            SCENE III. A room in Polonius' house.
            <p> Enter LAERTES and OPHELIA </p>

                <p class="stanza-title">LAERTES</p>

                    And, sister, as the winds give benefit<br>
                    And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,<br>
                    But let me hear from you.</p>

                <p class="stanza"> For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,<br>
                    Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,<br>
                    A violet in the youth of primy nature,<br>
                    Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,<br>
                    The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="ophelia">
                <p class="stanza-title" >OPHELIA</p>
                <p class="stanza"> No more but so?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="laertes">
                <p class="stanza-title" >LAERTES</p>
                <p class="stanza"> Think it no more;<br>
                    For nature, crescent, does not grow alone<br>
                    In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,<br>
                    The inward service of the mind and soul<br>
                    Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,<br>
                    And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch<br>
                    The virtue of his will: but you must fear,<br>
                    His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;<br>
                    For he himself is subject to his birth:<br>
                    He may not, as unvalued persons do,<br>
                    Carve for himself; for on his choice depends<br>
                    The safety and health of this whole state;<br>
                    And therefore must his choice be circumscribed<br>
                    Unto the voice and yielding of that body<br>
                    Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,<br>
                    It fits your wisdom so far to believe it<br>
                    As he in his particular act and place<br>
                    May give his saying deed; which is no further<br>
                    Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.<br>
                    Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,<br>
                    If with too credent ear you list his songs,<br>
                    Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open<br>
                    To his unmaster'd importunity.<br>
                    Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,<br>
                    And keep you in the rear of your affection,<br>
                    Out of the shot and danger of desire.<br>
                    The chariest maid is prodigal enough,<br>
                    If she unmask her beauty to the moon:<br>
                    Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:<br>
                    The canker galls the infants of the spring,<br>
                    Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,<br>
                    And in the morn and liquid dew of youth<br>
                    Contagious blastments are most imminent.<br>
                    Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:<br>
                    Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.</p>

                    As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,<br>
                    Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,<br>
                    Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;<br>
                    Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,<br>
                    Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,<br>
                    And recks not his own rede.</p>

                    The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,<br>
                    And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!<br>
                    And these few precepts in thy memory<br>
                    See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,<br>
                    Nor any unproportioned thought his act.<br>
                    Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.<br>
                    Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,<br>
                    Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;<br>
                    But do not dull thy palm with entertainment<br>
                    Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware<br>
                    Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,<br>
                    Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.<br>
                    Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;<br>
                    Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.<br>
                    Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,<br>
                    But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;<br>
                    For the apparel oft proclaims the man,<br>
                    And they in France of the best rank and station<br>
                    Are of a most select and generous chief in that.<br>
                    Neither a borrower nor a lender be;<br>
                    For loan oft loses both itself and friend,<br>
                    And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.<br>
                    This above all: to thine ownself be true,<br>
                    And it must follow, as the night the day,<br>
                    Thou canst not then be false to any man.<br>
                    Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!</p>
